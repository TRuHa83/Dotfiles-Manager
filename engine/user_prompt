I'm going to provide you with a configuration file, I need you to classify it by applications.
If you don't know the file, mark it as unknown.
Generate a JSON with the following data:
APPLICATION, DESCRIPTION, CATEGORY, LEVEL and PATH
Level represents the importance that the file may have for the user.
Where 0 is very little and 5 is very important.

The file is: {item}
